# RestartExplorer
RestartExplorer is a program meant specifically to forcefully kill explorer.exe and bring it back in the event your entire shell hangs.

WHAT IT DOES?
The program forcefully ends explorer.exe before restarting explorer.exe .

WHEN SHOULD I USE THIS?
This tool should ONLY be used if the following criteria is met;
Your desktop is gone. (typically in this instance the desktop is replaced with a gray void.)
The desktop is frozen.
The taskbar isnt responding

WHY NOT USE TASK MANAGER?
Task manager can do this same exact thing but what if task manager isnt working? Or what if you're too lazy to open it? Then just use RestartExplorer!
